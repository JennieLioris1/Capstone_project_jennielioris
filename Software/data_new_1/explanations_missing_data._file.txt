As explained in the read me file, it is made the choice to have the data folders localy in the computer.
Due to github limitations it is  not possible to upload the data folder directly from the website. 
I tried to clone the repositoy locally to the computer but still some troubles appear.

From this point of view it would be preferable to modify the code to read directly the data from the url.
In order to do it is not only the code that should be changed but also the README file 
containing all the explanations and the
justifications for having prefered to  store the data localy to the computer.
Consequently the  data folder necessary to run the software is not included in the repository.
As mentioned in the README file the data  was downloaded from the url 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018 
and hopefully the datasets are available to be downloaed or used by this time.
So in the folder named data_new_1 file '2009_csv' or any other should be included.

I regret for this uncovenience but this work was made within too short  time
and i have spend many hours to complete the software and  make it as efficient as possible.
There is no remaining time to search how to upload large folders in github.
Thank you.
